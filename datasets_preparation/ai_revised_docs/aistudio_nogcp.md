Okay, I will revise the design proposal to align with Google-internal tools and practices, reducing dependency on external Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. This revision will incorporate tools like JAX, Scenic, TensorFlow, CNS, FlumeJava, Borg, internal Colab, and Spanner where appropriate.
Here's the revised LSM Unified Data Pipeline Architecture:
LSM Unified Data Pipeline Architecture (Google Internal)
This document outlines the architecture for a unified data pipeline designed to process sensor data from multiple sources for training Large Sensor Models (LSM) within Google's infrastructure. The pipeline is designed to be flexible, scalable, and support batch processing (potentially using FlumeJava for very large datasets or Python scripts on Borg for others) and parallel processing in Colab (Google's internal version) or CLI environments for development and smaller tasks.

(Note: CNS paths in the "Data Sources" table of the requirements document should be filled with actual CNS locations.)
2. Core Components (Leveraging Google Internal Infrastructure)
2.1 Data Ingestion Layer
CNS Data Connectors
Standardized connectors for reading diverse raw data formats from CNS (Colossus Name System / Google File System).
Implemented using Python with internal Google libraries for CNS access, or as input stages in FlumeJava pipelines.
Support for batch ingestion. If streaming is required, internal Google streaming technologies would be used.
Automatic schema detection (best-effort with initial parsing scripts) and validation against predefined schemas.
Timezone handling and standardization as an early processing step.
Data Validation
Schema validation against Protocol Buffer definitions.
Data quality checks (e.g., null percentages, value ranges, enum consistency) implemented in Python scripts (potentially leveraging concepts from TensorFlow Data Validation - TFDV if its core libraries are usable standalone) or as FlumeJava stages.
Missing data detection and outlier identification. Statistics can be written to CNS or Spanner.
Schema Management (Protocol Buffers)
Centralized schema definitions using Protocol Buffers (Protobufs).
Schemas stored and versioned in Google's internal SCM (e.g., Piper).
Used for data parsing, validation, and ensuring consistency between producers and consumers.
2.2 Data Processing Layer (Powered by FlumeJava or Python on Borg)
This layer executes as distributed jobs, either using FlumeJava for large-scale, robust batch processing, or Python scripts orchestrated and run on Borg for greater flexibility with Python-native libraries.
Data Cleaning
Standardized cleaning procedures per sensor type (e.g., handling impossible values, filtering noisy segments).
Implemented as custom Python functions/classes or FlumeJava DoFns.
Handling of invalid/missing values based on predefined strategies.
Outlier removal or capping.
Data type standardization.
Feature Extraction & Engineering
Sensor-specific feature extraction (e.g., calculating HRV from PPG, step counts from accelerometer) and generation of a common feature set across datasets.
Leverages TensorFlow or JAX for numerical computations within Python scripts or FlumeJava stages.
Principles from TensorFlow Transform (TFT) (e.g., analyze-and-transform) can be applied: compute global statistics (means, variances, vocabularies) in one pass, then apply transformations in another.
Feature validation and documentation maintained alongside the processing code.
Data Normalization
Standardized normalization procedures (e.g., z-score, min-max scaling) implemented using TensorFlow/JAX operations.
Per-feature normalization parameters computed during an analysis phase (similar to TFT) and applied consistently.
Missing Data Handling
Strategies for imputing missing data (e.g., mean, median, forward/backward fill, zero-fill) or generating missingness indicators.
Implemented in Python scripts or FlumeJava.
Data Windowing
Configurable window sizes, overlap, and stride for segmenting time-series data.
Window validation (e.g., ensuring sufficient data points per window).
Centralized Caption Generation Class
A Python class/module responsible for generating descriptive text captions for data samples/windows.
Uses dataset metadata (source, sensor types, processing steps) and potentially label information.
Crucial for training foundation models with text-conditioned representations.
Integrated into the FlumeJava/Python processing jobs.
2.3 Data Storage Layer (CNS, Spanner/Metadata Files)
TFRecord Storage (CNS)
Processed, windowed, and captioned data stored in TFRecord format on CNS for efficient I/O during model training with TensorFlow or JAX/Scenic.
Leverage CNS for scalability, durability, and access control.
Sharding of TFRecords handled by the output stage of processing jobs.
Metadata Storage
Dataset Versioning & Processing Parameters:
Key metadata (e.g., dataset version, source datasets, processing parameters, TFDV statistics paths, label mappings, demographics filters used) stored in:
Spanner: For structured, queryable metadata, enabling complex queries about dataset lineage and characteristics.
Protocol Buffer files on CNS: For simpler, self-contained metadata alongside the data, or when Spanner is overkill.
The "Centralized Data Meta Data Class" from requirements is realized by Protobuf definitions for metadata and the Python classes that interact with Spanner or these files.
Data quality metrics and feature statistics generated during processing are also stored.
Version Control
Data Versioning:
Use CNS path conventions (e.g., cns://<path>/<dataset_name>/<version>/).
Leverage CNS snapshot capabilities if needed.
Processing Pipeline Code & Configuration:
Versioned in Google's internal SCM (e.g., Piper).
Schema Versioning:
Protobuf schema files versioned in Piper.
2.4 Data Access Layer (TFDS, TensorFlow/JAX Data Loaders)
TFDS Interface
Develop custom TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) builders to load the processed TFRecords from CNS.
This provides a standardized, easy-to-use interface for training pipelines.
TFDS builders can handle dataset splitting (train/val/test), shuffling, and prefetching.
Data Loaders (TensorFlow & JAX/Scenic)
For TensorFlow models: tf.data.Dataset API for efficient data loading from TFRecords on CNS.
For JAX models (e.g., using Scenic):
Scenic provides scenic.dataset_lib which can be adapted.
Custom JAX data loading pipelines reading from TFRecords on CNS, often using tf.data.Dataset.as_numpy_iterator() or similar mechanisms for bridging.
Parallel data loading managed by tf.data or JAX's data utilities and distributed training setup on Borg.
Data Inspection Tools
Colab (internal): For interactive exploration of raw and processed data, visualization of statistics, and debugging data loaders.
Custom Python scripts using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, executed locally or in Colab, reading data samples from CNS.
If TFDV is used, its visualization utilities can be employed within Colab.
3. Implementation Details
3.1 Processing Pipeline (FlumeJava or Python on Borg)
The LSMDatasetProcessor class would encapsulate the logic for a single dataset or a stage.
# Conceptual Python structure for a processing stage (runnable on Borg or locally)
import tensorflow as tf
import jax.numpy as jnp # If using JAX for some computations
# from internal_google.cns import CNSClient # Hypothetical CNS client
# from internal_google.borg import BorgJob # Hypothetical Borg job submission
# from ... import schema_pb2 # Your compiled protobufs

class LSMDatasetProcessor:
    def __init__(self, config: "PipelineConfig"): # Forward reference PipelineConfig
        self.config = config
        # self.cns_client = CNSClient()

    def _ingest_data_from_cns(self, cns_path: str) -> tf.data.Dataset: # Or other iterable
        # Logic to read and parse raw data from CNS
        # Example: return tf.data.TextLineDataset([f"cns://{cns_path}/*"])
        #           .map(self._parse_raw_log)
        print(f"Ingesting from {cns_path}...")
        # This would use internal libraries to read from CNS.
        # For demonstration, let's assume it returns a list of dictionaries
        # In reality, this would be a generator or a tf.data.Dataset for large files.
        mock_data = [{"hr": 70, "steps": 100, "timestamp": 1678886400+i} for i in range(1000)]
        return mock_data # Placeholder

    def _validate_data(self, raw_data_iter): # Input is an iterable
        # Apply schema validation (Protobufs) and TFDV-like checks
        # Example:
        # for record in raw_data_iter:
        #    try:
        #        # proto_instance = schema_pb2.SensorReading()
        #        # proto_instance.ParseFromString(record_bytes) # If bytes
        #        # self.validator.validate(record) # If dicts
        #    except Exception as e:
        #        # log error, skip record, or fail

        # Apply feature engineering using TF/JAX ops
        # Uses self.feature_extractor initialized from config

        # Example:
        # processed_features = []
        # for record in validated_data:

        #    processed_features.append(features)
        return validated_data # Placeholder

    def _normalize_data(self, features):
        # Apply normalization
        print("Normalizing data...")
        return features # Placeholder

    def _handle_missing_data(self, normalized_data):
        print("Handling missing data...")
        return normalized_data # Placeholder

    def _create_windows(self, processed_data):
        # Apply windowing logic
        print("Creating windows...")
        # This would be complex, involving iterating and creating overlapping/non-overlapping windows
        # For simplicity, assume each record is a "window"
        return processed_data # Placeholder

    def _generate_captions(self, windowed_data, data_source_name: str):
        # Use self.caption_generator
        print(f"Generating captions for {data_source_name}...")
        captioned_data = []
        for item in windowed_data:
            # caption = f"Sensor data from {data_source_name} including HR and Steps." # Simplified
            # item['caption'] = caption
            captioned_data.append(item)
        return captioned_data

    def _create_tfrecords(self, captioned_data, output_cns_path: str):
        # Convert to tf.train.Example and write to TFRecords on CNS
        print(f"Writing TFRecords to {output_cns_path}...")
        # with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(f"cns://{output_cns_path}/part-00000.tfrecord") as writer:
        #    for item in captioned_data:
        #        # example = create_tf_example(item) # Your conversion function

        print(f"Finished processing {data_source_name}. Output at {output_cns_path}")
Use code with caution.
Python
3.2 Configuration Management
Configuration will be managed using text-based Protocol Buffers or YAML files, stored in Piper and passed to processing jobs.
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Any

# Example using dataclasses, can be mapped to/from Protobufs
@dataclass
class DataSourceConfig:
    name: str
    cns_path: str # Raw data location on CNS
    label_cns_path: str # Label location on CNS
    output_cns_path: str # Processed output on CNS
    schema_version: str # Refers to a schema in Piper

@dataclass
class ProcessingConfig:
    window_size_samples: int # Or seconds, depends on data
    window_overlap_samples: int
    min_data_points_per_window: int
    missing_value_threshold_feature_drop: float
    # ... other processing params

@dataclass
class FeatureConfig:
    features_to_include: List[str]
    normalization_params: Dict[str, Any] # e.g., {'hr': {'strategy': 'z_score'}}
    # ... feature specific configs

@dataclass
class PipelineConfig:
    pipeline_name: str
    pipeline_version: str
    data_sources: List[DataSourceConfig]
    processing_config: ProcessingConfig
    feature_config: FeatureConfig
    output_format: str = "tfrecord"
    # FlumeJava/Borg job parameters (e.g., num_workers, machine_type)
Use code with caution.
Python
3.3 Feature Processing
The FeatureProcessor concept is integrated into the LSMDatasetProcessor or as separate modules/libraries called by it. These will use TensorFlow and JAX for numerical operations.
4. Usage Examples
4.1 Batch Processing (FlumeJava or Python on Borg)
FlumeJava: For very large datasets where its MapReduce-like paradigm and robustness are beneficial. FlumeJava pipelines would be defined in Java, potentially calling out to Python scripts for specific tasks if necessary (via side inputs or custom PTransforms that wrap binaries).
// Conceptual FlumeJava Snippet (actual API is different)
// PCollection<String> rawLines = pipeline.apply(CNS.read().from("cns://..."));
// PCollection<SensorReadingProto> parsedData = rawLines.apply(ParDo.of(new ParseFn()));
// PCollection<WindowedFeatureProto> processedData = parsedData
//     .apply(ParDo.of(new ValidateAndCleanFn()))
//     .apply(ParDo.of(new ExtractFeaturesFn())) // Might use JNI to call JAX/TF C++ libs or invoke python binary
//     .apply(ParDo.of(new WindowAndCaptionFn()));
// processedData.apply(CNS.writeTFRecords().to("cns://output/..."));
// pipeline.run();
Use code with caution.
Java
Python on Borg: For many tasks, Python scripts using libraries like TensorFlow, JAX, Pandas, and custom modules can be parallelized and run efficiently on Borg. A workflow manager internal to Google would orchestrate these Borg jobs.
# main_borg_script.py
# import argparse
# from pipeline_module import LSMDatasetProcessor, PipelineConfig, load_config_from_file
# from internal_google.borg import get_borg_task_info # Hypothetical

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
#    parser.add_argument("--config_path_on_cns", required=True)
#    parser.add_argument("--data_source_index", type=int, required=True) # For processing one source per task
#    args = parser.parse_args()

#    # config_proto = load_config_from_file(args.config_path_on_cns) # Load from text proto on CNS
#    # pipeline_config = PipelineConfig.from_proto(config_proto) # Convert
      # Mock config for this example
#    pipeline_config = PipelineConfig(
#        pipeline_name="lsm_pipeline", pipeline_version="v1",
#        data_sources=[
#             DataSourceConfig("Tier-2 PROD", "cns://path/to/tier2", "cns://path/to/tier2_labels", "cns://output/tier2", "v1.0"),
#             # ... other sources
#        ],
#        processing_config=ProcessingConfig(window_size_samples=100, window_overlap_samples=50, min_data_points_per_window=10, missing_value_threshold_feature_drop=0.5),
#        feature_config=FeatureConfig(features_to_include=['hr', 'steps'], normalization_params={})
#    )


#    processor = LSMDatasetProcessor(pipeline_config)
#    data_source_to_process = pipeline_config.data_sources[args.data_source_index]
#    processor.process_dataset(data_source_to_process)

# This script would be launched as multiple Borg tasks, each handling a subset of data_sources.
Use code with caution.
Python
4.2 Parallel Processing & Development (Colab/CLI)
Colab (Internal): Used for developing processing logic, experimenting with feature transformations on data samples read from CNS, and running smaller-scale parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing or JAX's pmap (if on a machine with multiple accelerators).
# Colab example
# from multiprocessing import Pool
# from pipeline_module import LSMDatasetProcessor, PipelineConfig # (Simplified for Colab use)

# def process_wrapper(args):
#     processor, data_source_cfg = args
#     return processor.process_dataset(data_source_cfg) # Assume returns status or output path

# if __name__ == "__main__": # Standard Colab cell execution
#     # Load or define pipeline_config for a subset of data
#     # pipeline_config = ...
#     # processor = LSMDatasetProcessor(pipeline_config)

#     # data_sources_subset = [pipeline_config.data_sources[0]] # Example
#     # map_args = [(processor, ds_cfg) for ds_cfg in data_sources_subset]

#     # num_processes = min(4, len(data_sources_subset)) # Limit processes in Colab
#     # with Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
#     #     results = pool.map(process_wrapper, map_args)
#     # print(results)
#     pass # Placeholder for actual Colab execution
Use code with caution.
Python
CLI: Python scripts can be run from the command line for individual dataset processing or testing, reading/writing to local file system representations of CNS or directly to CNS for smaller tests.
5. Data Quality and Monitoring
5.1 Quality Metrics
Generated by Python scripts (potentially using TFDV concepts or custom logic) during processing jobs.
Metrics include missing data ratios, distribution statistics (mean, std, percentiles), outlier counts, schema conformance checks.
Stored as Protocol Buffer files on CNS alongside processed data, or in Spanner tables for aggregated analysis.
5.2 Monitoring
Borg Jobs: Monitored using Google's internal Borgmon system for resource utilization, task failures, logs.
FlumeJava Jobs: Monitored via FlumeJava's own UI and logging integrated with Google's systems.
Custom dashboards can be built using internal tools to track data quality metrics over time from Spanner or aggregated CNS files.
Alerts configured for pipeline failures or significant data quality degradations.
6. Future Improvements
Scalability & Efficiency:
Fine-tune FlumeJava job configurations and Python-on-Borg resource requests.
Optimize I/O patterns for CNS.
Explore JAX/TensorFlow compiler optimizations (XLA) for performance-critical feature computations.
Flexibility & Modularity:
Develop a shared library of common sensor data processing functions (Python/Java) usable across projects.
Improve parameterization and configurability of processing stages.
Advanced Monitoring & Lineage:
More detailed lineage tracking, potentially using Spanner to link raw data versions, processing job IDs, configurations, and output TFRecord versions.
Automated anomaly detection on data quality metrics.
Documentation & Reproducibility:
Auto-generate documentation for pipeline configurations and data schemas (Protobufs).
Ensure all processing runs are logged with exact configurations and code versions for reproducibility.
Integration with Model Training (Scenic/JAX/TF on Borg):
Streamline the path from processed TFRecords on CNS to training jobs using TFDS, Scenic data loaders, running on Borg-managed TPUs/GPUs.
7. Implementation Notes
All code primarily in Python 3.x and Java (for FlumeJava).
Utilize TensorFlow (tf.data, TFRecords, core ops) and JAX (for numerical computation, potentially with Scenic for JAX-based modeling).
Adhere to Google's internal coding standards and best practices.
Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all processing components.
Document all public APIs, data schemas (Protobufs), and pipeline configurations in internal systems (e.g., g3doc, wikis).
Use type hints in Python.
Implement robust error handling, logging, and checkpointing (where appropriate) in processing jobs.
Processing jobs on Borg can request appropriate CPU/RAM/accelerator resources.
Data validation checks at multiple points in the pipeline.
Strict versioning for data (CNS paths), code (Piper), schemas (Piper), and configurations.
This revised proposal focuses on Google's internal toolchain, as requested.
